    <p>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar <b>14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956</b> was an <hr>Indian jurist, economist, social reformer and political leader who headed the committee drafting the Constitution of India from the Constituent Assembly debates, served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru, and inspired <b>the Dalit Buddhist movement</b> after renouncing Hinduism.

        After graduating from Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, Ambedkar studied economics at <b>Columbia University</b> and <b>the London School of Economics</b>, receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923, respectively, and was among a handful of Indian students to have done so at either institution in the 1920s. He also trained in the <b>law at Gray's Inn, London</b>. In his early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for partition, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing to the establishment of the state of India. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits.[4]
        
        In 1990, <b>the Bharat Ratna</b>, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred on Ambedkar. The salutation <b>Jai Bhim</b> (lit. "Hail Bhim") used by followers honours him. He is also referred to by the nickname <b>Babasaheb</b> (BAH-bə SAH-hayb), meaning <b>"Respected Father"</b>.</p>
        <p1>In 1913, at the age of 22, Ambedkar was awarded a Baroda State Scholarship of £11.50 (Sterling) per month for three years under a scheme established by Sayajirao Gaekwad III (Gaekwad of Baroda) that was designed to provide opportunities for postgraduate education at Columbia University in New York City. Soon after arriving there he settled in rooms at Livingston Hall with Naval Bhathena, a Parsi who was to be a lifelong friend. He passed his M.A. exam in June 1915, majoring in economics, and other subjects of Sociology, History, Philosophy and Anthropology. He presented a thesis, <b>Ancient Indian Commerce</b>. Ambedkar was influenced by John Dewey and his work on democracy. In 1916, he completed his second master's thesis, National Dividend of India – A Historic and Analytical Study, for a second M.A. On 9 May, he presented the paper Castes in India: Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development before a seminar conducted by the <b>anthropologist Alexander Goldenweiser</b>. Ambedkar received his Ph.D. degree in economics at <b>Columbia</b> in 1927.As Ambedkar was educated by <b>the Princely State of Baroda</b>, he was bound to serve it. He was appointed Military Secretary to the Gaikwad but had to quit in a short time. He described the incident in his autobiography, Waiting for a Visa.
            Thereafter, he tried to find ways to make a<pre> living for</pre> his growing family. He worked as a private tutor, as an accountant, and established an investment consulting business, but it failed when his clients learned that he was an untouchable. In 1918, he became professor of political economy in the <b>Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics in Mumbai</b>. Although he was successful with the students, other professors objected to his sharing a drinking-water jug with them.[28]

            Ambedkar had been invited to testify before <b>the Southborough Committee</b>, which was preparing <b>the Government of India Act 1919</b>. At this hearing, Ambedkar argued for creating separate electorates and reservations for untouchables and other religious communities. In 1920, he began the publication of the weekly Mooknayak (Leader of the Silent) in Mumbai with the help of Shahu of Kolhapur, that is, Shahu IV (1874–1922).[30]
            
            Ambedkar went on to work as a legal professional. In 1926, he successfully defended three non-Brahmin leaders who had accused the Brahmin community of ruining India and were then subsequently sued for libel. Dhananjay Keer notes, <b>"The victory was resounding, both socially and individually, for the clients and the doctor"</b>.
            <p2>In 1932, the British colonial government announced the formation of a separate electorate for <b>"Depressed Classes"</b> in the Communal Award. Mahatma Gandhi fiercely opposed a separate electorate for untouchables, saying he feared that such an arrangement would divide the Hindu community. Gandhi protested by fasting while imprisoned in the Yerwada Central Jail of Poona. Following the fast, congressional politicians and activists such as Madan Mohan Malaviya and Palwankar Baloo organised joint meetings with Ambedkar and his supporters at Yerwada. On <b>25 September 1932</b>, the agreement, known as the <b>Poona Pact</b> was signed between Ambedkar (on behalf of the depressed classes among Hindus) and Madan Mohan Malaviya (on behalf of the other Hindus). The agreement gave reserved seats for the depressed classes in the Provisional legislatures within the general electorate. Due to the pact the depressed class received 148 seats in the legislature instead of the 71, as allocated in the Communal Award proposed earlier by the colonial government under Prime Minister <b>Ramsay MacDonald</b>. The text used the term "Depressed Classes" to denote Untouchables among Hindus who were later called Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under the India Act 1935, and the later Indian Constitution of 1950. In the Poona Pact, a unified electorate was in principle formed, but primary and secondary elections allowed Untouchables in practice to choose their own candidates.</p2>
